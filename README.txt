FL-Essentials is a FLTK and OpenCV based software system which 
provides extreme easiness in building GUI applications. It 
consists of C++ class library and gives thread-safe image 
processing support. It makes FLTK functionality easier, faster, 
and lighter. It works fine as a static or shared library.
